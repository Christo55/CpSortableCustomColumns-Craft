# CP Sortable Custom Columns v. 1.0.0 for Craft CMS ![Craft 2.5](https://img.shields.io/badge/craft-2.5-red.svg?style=flat-square)

_Sort your element indexes on custom fields_  

## What?

The Customizable Element Index (CEI) feature in Craft 2.5+ lets users show or hide any custom field and/or metadata to the element indexes (i.e. the table listing your Entries, Categories, Assets or Users). Awesome stuff! Unfortunately though, Craft won't actually let you _sort_ elements on these values â€“ until now.  

CP Sortable Custom Columns is a tiny plugin with a heavy handed name; hotfixing this annoying issue by hacking in support for sorting on most custom fields and meta values

* Number
